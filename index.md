## A guide to making Kombucha

Kombucha is fairly easy to make, and a batch can be started within an hour. You'll need a pre-existing culture to get started, or to find a SCOBY. I'd recommend asking a friend for a SCOBY, if you know someone brewing already. However, you can buy them online if you don't have one yet.

### Ingredients

- A SCOBY
- 200ml kombucha (from a previous batch)
- 100 - 200g sugar
- 2-3L of filtered water
- 20g, or 4 bags of tea

### Steps

1. Add the sugar, an equal weight of water, and tea to a pan. Bring this to a boil and stir until all the sugar has dissolved. You may prefer to dissolve the sugar before adding the tea. Allow this to brew until it's potent and sweet.
1. Let the hot and sweet tea cool completely to avoid killing the sensitive bacteria which your SCOBY is composed of.
1. Combine the tea with the remainder of the water and the kombucha from a previous batch. Mix this all thoroughly. You'll need a large jar, perhaps with a tap. Ensure the jar is completely clean to avoid bringing malicious bacterias into the mix.
1. With clean hands, gently drop your SCOBY into the top of the jar. It should float to the top, but don't worry if it doesn't immediately, it will once it gets settled into its new home.
1. Cover the top of the jar with a clean tea towel and secure with a rubber band. The kombucha needs access to oxygen to be able to breathe. Essentially, the SCOBY is an interface between the sugary liquid and air and this is how it survives and thrives.
1. Taste the kombucha immediately. You'll want to know exactly what it tastes like at the start of its journey, you can then have a wee dram of it each day to understand the flavour change as the fermentation happens.
1. After 3 - 8 days, your kombucha should be ready to bottle. Add a spoon of sugar to a strong bottle, and pour in your kombucha. The sugar will help you get some extra fizz in the final product. If you're pouring the kombucha from the jar (rather than using a tap), you'll wanna take your SCOBY out to rest in a safe place so it stays outta harm's way. She's a delicate wee raft of bacteria after all!

### Notes

- Using kombucha from a previous batch kickstarts the fermentation process. This process is known as backslopping.
- Instead of tea you can use other flavourings, such as: camomile, lavender, hibiscus, or mint.
- Sugar dissolves in an equal weight of water, so by only using the exact amount you need the sugar will dissolve quick and with less heat required than if you added all the water at once.
- Here, I'm not precise about sugar and water ratio's. Kombucha is fairly forgiving as far as ferments go. While you can be quite precise and scientific, it's good to get a handle on what kind of ratio you enjoy. Usually, I'll make about 3L of Kombucha using 200g of sugar and this has kept my culture healthy for quite some time.
- Finally, don't worry about the sugar content. Your wee pal, Ms. SCOBY is gonna eat the vast majority of the sugar you add, so your final product will taste acidic, and the sugar content will be reasonable. Again, I'm no scientist so I aint got no idea how much sugar ends up in the final product.
